# Extra-Machine-Learning
I just tried to learn a little bit extra on Machine Learning with several projects

In the file: O2 saturation regression file, I did a regression in addition to classification of the data. This because the data itself was continous rather than discrete. The TA later demanded that I deliver a classification instead.
